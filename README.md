## About me

I am a first year Master's student in [Chris Elphick's](https://elphick.lab.uconn.edu) lab, in the [University of Connecticut's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.](https://eeb.uconn.edu).

I am primarily interested in animal behavior and habitat restoration. I am also interested in animal personality and individuality, animal learning behaviors, evolution and its relation to animal behavior, and avian ecology.

I completed my Bachelor of Science at Bucknell University, where I majored in Animal Behavior.
